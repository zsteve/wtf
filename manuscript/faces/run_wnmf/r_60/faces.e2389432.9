Matplotlib created a temporary config/cache directory at /tmp/pbs.2389432[9].pbsha.ib.sockeye/matplotlib-itnbidrf because the default path (/home/szhang99/.config/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
